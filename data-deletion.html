    <p>This page explains how users of <strong>Your App Name</strong> can request the deletion of their personal data collected by the app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with data protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA.</p>
    
    <h2>Steps to Request Data Deletion</h2>
    <ol>

        <li><strong>Submit a Request</strong>: Fill out the form with your full name, email address associated with the app, and a brief reason (optional). Confirm your identity if prompted.</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative: Email Us Directly</strong>: If the in-app option isn't available, send an email to <strong>your-email@example.com</strong> with the subject line "Data Deletion Request". Include:

    </div>
    
    <h2>Processing Your Request</h2>
    <p>We will acknowledge your request within <strong>48 hours</strong> and process it within <strong>30 days</strong> (or sooner, as required by law). This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deleting your personal data from our servers and backups.</li>
        <li>Notifying any third-party services (if applicable).</li>
        <li>Stopping further processing of your data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Confirmation</h2>
    <p>Once complete, we'll send a confirmation email to the address you provided, detailing what was deleted. If your request is denied (e.g., due to legal obligations), we'll explain why.</p>
